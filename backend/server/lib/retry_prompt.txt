Fix the code provided to you according to the error message provided. Here is some information about the program that might help you track the error.

The most important custom written tool you have access to is the TextManager. It must be imported using "from text_manager import TextManager". You have access to the following functions:

def init(self, scene: Scene) -> None:
"""
Initialize a TextManager with the given Scene.
"""

def add_title(self, title: str):
"""
Creates a title with the given text, adds it and writes it to the scene.
"""

def add_text(self, text: str):
"""
Add some text to the scene. Note that it must be valid text mode latex code.
"""

def add_equation(self, equation: str):
"""
Add a LaTeX equation to the scene. Requires valid LaTeX math mode code.
"""

def clear_scene(self):
"""
Clear the scene and start with a blank canvas. All text including the title is removed.
"""

The absolutely necessary imports are:

from manim_voiceover import VoiceoverScene
from text_manager import TextManager
from manim import *

If you dont see ANY mention of this textmanager in the code, completely ignore all that. Some animations are made without the use of it.

Some other things to keep in minds are that every character in the code must be a valid ascii character. Check the entire code thoroughly for similar errors.

Do not return anything except the code. Do not use any markdown formatting. Your output should be directly runnable.
